##4#4 Unleash Ruby

Want to try out multiple Rubyâ€™s on your android version without wrecking your current Ruby setup?

Uru is a lightweight, multi-platform command line tool that helps you use the multiple rubies (currently MRI, JRuby, and Rubinius) on your 32/64-bit Linux, OS X, or android versions.
You can [download it here](https://bitbucket.org/jonforums/uru/wiki/Downloads).
